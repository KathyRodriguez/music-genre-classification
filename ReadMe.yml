## Music Genre Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify songs into their corresponding music genres based on their audio features, such as tempo, key, and spectral properties. The model is built using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

# Installation

To run the Music Genre Classification model:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Download the dataset of music features and labels and store it in a file named music_data.csv.
4. Run the music_genre_classification.py script to preprocess the data, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance.

# Usage

To use the Music Genre Classification model:

1. After installation, run the music_genre_classification.py script.
2. The script will preprocess the data, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. The script will output the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report of the model on the testing data.
